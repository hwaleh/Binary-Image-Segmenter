# Binary-Image-Segmenter

## General Info
This repository contains project code for a binary image segmentation model. The goal of this project was to learn about the applications of computer vision and build a functional tool in this domain. 

This repository conatins the full model pipeline, from collecting and processing our data to viewing the final output of the model. It also contains example code for a full CNN pipeline written to help team mates understand ML fundamentals. 

## Model Info
It features a U-NET model, which was created to assist in biomedical image segmentation. Our project applies this model to a similar task- semantic segmentation. The goal is, given a person's portrait, to separate the person from their background.

## Results
To see our project's effectiveness, view the end of our model pipeline. It features a random sampling of portaits and our model's segmenting ability on them.
