# Binary-Image-Segmenter

## General Info
This repository contains project code for a binary image segmentation model. The goal of this project was to learn about the applications of computer vision and build a functional tool in this domain. 

You can view our full model pipeline, from collecting and processing our data to the final output of the model. Note that the final output features a selection of the original portaits in addition to our model's segmented versions.

You can also find example code for a full CNN pipeline written to help team mates understand ML fundamentals. This guide was created by me and features 2 models: one that performs poorly due to bad architecture and parameters, and one that performs very well due to better techniques and parameters.

## Model Info
This project features a U-NET model, which was created to assist in biomedical image segmentation. We selected this model because it is relatively simple in architecture while being proficient in image segmentation. Our project applies this model to a task similar to its original use case- semantic segmentation. The goal is, given a person's portrait, to separate the person from their background (the rest of the image in this case).

## Results
To see our project's effectiveness, view the end of our model pipeline. It features a random sampling of portaits and our model's segmenting ability on them.
